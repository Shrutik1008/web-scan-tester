# 🛡️ WebScan Pro
### Automated Web Application Security Testing Tool

WebScan Pro is an intelligent security-testing tool designed to automatically detect vulnerabilities in web applications. It simulates real-world attack vectors, scans targets for weaknesses, and generates detailed security reports with recommended fixes.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of WebScan Pro is to perform automated penetration testing on web applications by detecting common vulnerabilities such as:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Broken Authentication
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Access control flaws
- Session issues
